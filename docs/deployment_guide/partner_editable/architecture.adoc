As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Quick Start deploys the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* An internet gateway to provide access to the internet.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** Microsoft Remote Desktop Gateway (RD Gateway) instances in an Auto Scaling group to provide inbound remote administrative access.*
** WAP servers to provide secure inbound connectivity to web applications.
* In the private subnets:
** Two Active Directory domain controllers in a security group. These act as enterprise certificate authorities (CAs) to issue required SSL certificates to the AD FS infrastructure.*
** Two Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) servers in a security group running on Windows Server 2022.
