== Postdeployment steps

:xrefstyle: short
=== Run windows updates

In order to ensure the deployed servers' operating systems and installed applications have the latest Microsoft updates, run Windows Update on each server.

1. Create an RDP session from the Remote Desktop Gateway server to each deployed server.
2. Open the *Settings* application.
3. Open *Update & Security*.
4. Click *Check for updates*.
5. Install any updates and reboot if necessary.

[[design-considerations]]
== Design considerations

Although this Quick Start is designed for to support 1,000 to 15,000 users, there are a number of options. The following recommendations can help determine the minimum number of servers to deploy for your scenario. These recommendations are based on a hardware profile that supports 8 CPU cores, 4 GiB of RAM, and a 1 gigabit network connection.

* *Fewer than 1,000 users* – A small environment can use existing infrastructure instead of running dedicated AD FS servers. If you need to support fewer than 1,000 users, you can install AD FS on at least two of your domain controllers. Ideally, these domain controllers should be in two separate Availability Zones.
* *1,000 to 15,000 users* – In this scenario, Microsoft recommends using a dedicated AD FS and WAP server infrastructure. The AD FS database can run using a Windows Internal Database (WID), so you’ll need four servers (two WAP and two AD FS).
* *15,000 to 60,000 users* – For large environments, Microsoft recommends using three to five dedicated AD FS servers, and at least two dedicated WAP servers. Note that if you’re scaling beyond five dedicated AD FS servers, you’ll need a dedicated SQL Server instance instead of running a WID.

[[selecting-an-instance-type]]
=== Selecting an instance type

AD FS is considered a processor-bound workload, meaning that CPU resources are the highest in demand. This Quick Start uses C4 compute-optimized instances by default.

Specifically, the c4.2xlarge instance type is used to provide 8 vCPUs and 15 GiB of memory to meet or exceed requirements, based on the recommendations in the previous section. Additionally, the c4.2xlarge instance type supports Amazon EBS optimization, enhanced networking, and high network performance, which results in higher packets per second, lower latency, and lower jitter. Although c4.2xlarge provides more memory than required, it’s a great candidate for workloads running in a production environment.

[[database-options]]
=== Database options

The recommended topology for AD FS is to create a federation server farm that includes at least two AD FS servers. When you install AD FS on the first server, the federation server farm is created. You can join the next server to the farm, and then load-balance those servers.

An AD FS federation server farm uses a database to hold configuration data. For farms with five or fewer servers, you can use a Windows Internal Database (WID). The primary AD FS server will have a read/write copy of this database. The secondary AD FS servers in the farm receive updates from the primary server to a read-only copy of the WID. If the primary AD FS server fails, the secondary server can still process authentication requests, but you cannot make configuration changes until either the primary server is brought back online or the secondary server is converted to primary.

For federation server farms that have more than five AD FS servers, you’ll need to use a SQL Server database for the configuration database. When you use SQL Server for your AD FS database, all members in the federation server farm have write access to the configuration data.

Microsoft recommends that you use WID until you scale past five AD FS servers. This Quick Start utilizes WID with AD FS by default.

[[load-balancing]]
=== Load balancing

For production deployments, you should implement load balancing to make your WAP and AD FS services highly available. You can use Elastic Load Balancing or a third-party virtual load balancer appliance.

Both the WAP and AD FS layers can be load balanced individually with Elastic Load Balancing. You can deploy an Internet-facing load balancer for the WAP layer that will service users accessing published web applications over the Internet. In addition, you can configure an internal load balancer for the AD FS servers. You would then configure the WAP layer to point to the load-balanced DNS name (for example, `sts.example.com`) that resolves to the internal load balancer.

To take advantage of header inspection, it is recommended that Application Load Balancers (rather than Network Load Balancers or Classic Load Balancers) be deployed. You should configure the internet-facing load balancer for the WAP layer to accept HTTPS requests on port 443 and to forward requests to the WAP servers. You must assign a certificate obtained from a trusted third-party CA to the listener for the internet-facing load balancer. For listener of the internal load balancer, also configured to accept HTTPS requests on port 443, you can assign an internally-signed certificate.

For detailed load-balancing and health-check requirements, refer to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/overview/ad-fs-requirements[AD FS Requirements].

[[certificates]]
=== Certificates

Certificates are required to install both the WAP and AD FS components. This Quick Start automates the deployment and installation of these components by using certificates issued from an internal enterprise CA, which runs on the domain controller infrastructure. You can replace these certificates in your own production deployments. The requirements and recommendations for both the WAP and AD FS layers are discussed in the next two sections.

[[web-application-proxy-certificates]]
==== Web Application proxy certificates

* *Issuing CA* – Typically, the WAP infrastructure will use certificates issued from a commercial or public CA, such as DigiCert or Verisign, which should be installed in the computer’s personal certificate store. Using a public CA generally prevents you from having to install root certificates on your client devices. You can use your own public key infrastructure (PKI) to issue the WAP certificates. If you do, ensure that the client devices trust the issuing CA. To do this, install the root certificate on the devices and configure the URL of your certificate-revocation list to be externally accessible.
* *Certificate FQDNs* – You can explicitly set the certificate subject and subject alternative name (SAN) fields, or you can choose to use a wildcard certificate (for example, `*.example.com`). For explicit naming, set the subject field to the AD FS federation service name (for example, `sts.example.com`). If you plan to use the workplace join feature, you’ll also need two SAN entries: one for the federation service name (for example, `sts.example.com`) and one for enterprise registration in the format `enterpriseregistration._yourdomain_.com`. Additionally, you’ll want SAN entries for any fully qualified domain name (FQDN) that you will be publishing, such as externally facing SharePoint sites or Outlook on the web (OWA).

[[ad-fs-certificates]]
==== AD FS certificates

* *Issuing CA* – Typically, the AD FS infrastructure will use certificates issued from an internal PKI, such as an enterprise Active Directory CA. This is because the servers in the infrastructure are not internet-facing. This is especially useful in an Active Directory domain environment where all domain-joined machines will trust the issuing CA by default. If you choose not to join your WAP servers, you can install the CA root certificate on those servers in the computer’s trusted root CA store. If you do not have an existing PKI implementation, it’s probably easiest to use the same public certificate on both the WAP and AD FS servers.
* *Certificate FQDNs* – The AD FS certificate requires the federation service name to be set on the subject field (for example, `sts.example.com`). Or, you can use a wildcard certificate.

[[domain-joined-proxies]]
=== Domain-joined proxies

As your WAP servers are deployed to public subnets, you may choose not to join them to a domain. This is a typical practice for server workloads running in a perimeter zone. However, if the web application you want to publish must support Integrated Windows authentication, you should join the WAP servers.

This Quick Start automatically joins the WAP servers to the Active Directory Domain Services environment. For help publishing a web application that uses Integrated Windows authentication, refer to <<Publish Outlook on the web with AD FS preauthentication>>, later in this guide.

[[authentication-scenarios]]
=== Authentication Scenarios

Publishing web applications with WAP supports three authentication scenarios:

* *AD FS preauthentication* – In this scenario, users authenticate against AD FS before gaining access to the published web application. This requires that you add an AD FS relying party trust to the federation service. For detailed coverage on AD FS preauthentication flow, see https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn383640.aspx[Publish Applications using AD FS Preauthentication] in the Microsoft TechNet Library.
* *Client certificate preauthentication* – In this scenario, one or more external servers connect to an on-premises web application through the WAP infrastructure using a certificate for authentication. Despite the name, this scenario should not be used for client devices that connect to a published web application. For more information, see https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn584096.aspx[Publish Applications using Client Certificate Preauthentication].
* *Pass-through preauthentication* – In this scenario, access to the web application is proxied directly to the backend server without preauthentication against AD FS. This is the option you would use to make AD FS externally accessible. Subsequently published applications that use AD FS preauthentication access AD FS via pass-through preauthentication.

For an example that covers both AD FS and pass-through preauthentication, refer to <<Publish Outlook on the web with AD FS preauthentication>>, later in this guide.

== Security

When you build systems on the AWS infrastructure, security responsibilities are shared between you and AWS. This shared model can reduce your operational burden as AWS operates, manages, and controls the components from the host operating system and virtualization layer down to the physical security of the facilities in which the services operate. In turn, you assume responsibility and management of the guest operating system (including updates and security patches), other associated applications, as well as the configuration of the AWS-provided security group firewall. For more information about security on AWS, visit the http://aws.amazon.com/security/[AWS Security Center].

[[operating-system-security]]
=== Operating System Security

All the Windows Servers deployed by this Quick Start are domain-joined. You can authenticate to these instances by using the stackadmin@example.com domain administrator account. You can specify the password for this account as you launch the stack. You can retrieve the local administrator password for domain-joined instances by using the `KeyPairName` parameter specified during the launch. Operating system patches are your responsibility and should be performed on a periodic basis.

[[security-groups]]
=== Security Groups

A security group acts as a firewall that controls the traffic for one or more instances. When you launch an instance, you associate one or more security groups with the instance. You add rules to each security group that allow traffic to or from its associated instances. You can modify the rules for a security group at any time. The new rules are automatically applied to all instances that are associated with the security group.

The security groups created and assigned to the individual instances as part of this solution are restricted as much as possible while allowing access to the various functions needed by AD FS and WAP. After deployment, review security groups and further restrict access as needed.

== Publish Outlook on the web with AD FS preauthentication

In this section, you'll learn how to deploy WAP and AD FS infrastructure on top of the Microsoft Exchange on the AWS Cloud Quick Start and publish OWA to the internet using WAP and AD FS.

IMPORTANT: The template for WAP and AD FS provided with this guide is built to work with existing VPCs that have two public and two private subnets, and an existing Active Directory Domain Services implementation. More specifically, it is designed to work with the existing Microsoft-based AWS Quick Starts, such as Exchange Server, SharePoint Server, and Lync Server.

NOTE: In this section, the process of publishing OWA uses Integrated Windows authentication. You can follow the same general process for Exchange Server 2010, or other web applications you want to publish with Integrated Windows authentication. It is also possible to publish OWA with claims-based authentication using Exchange Server 2013 SP1 or newer, but that scenario is beyond the scope of this guide.

=== Deploy Quick Start templates

. Deploy the https://fwd.aws/NvamP[Microsoft Exchange on the AWS Cloud Quick Start].

. Deploy the https://fwd.aws/5VrKP[Web Application Proxy and AD FS template]. During deployment, specify the `KeyPairName` for your chosen AWS Region and the IDs for your existing VPC and public and private subnets.

=== Connect to a RD Gateway instance

. Initiate a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connection to one of the deployed RD Gateway instances. You can retrieve the Elastic IP address (EIP) of the RD Gateway servers from the https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-east-1#Home:[Amazon EC2 console]. Use RDP to connect to the first Exchange server (`exch1`).

. On the first Exchange server (`exch1`), navigate to the https://exch1/ecp[Exchange Admin Center] in a web browser. Sign in using the `stackadmin` user account and password you specified when deploying the Microsoft Exchange on AWS stack.

=== Test OWA access

Now you are ready to test accessing OWA from an external workstation or server over the internet.

. If you did not use your own domain name, you’ll need to edit the hosts file on your machine to allow your computer to resolve the endpoints at `example.com`. Add a mapping for `sts.example.com` and `mail.example.com` to your local hosts file. Ensure that both hosts resolve to the public EIP of the WAP1 server.

. Open a web browser from your external workstation or server. Navigate to `mail.example.com`. Sign in using the `stackadmin` user name and password.
